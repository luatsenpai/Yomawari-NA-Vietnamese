A normal rock.
If I throw it,
spirits might
react to it. It
could be useful.
Money. By saving
up, I can shop,
make an offering,
and do lots more.

White and
smooth salt.
Spirits don't
like it.

A small shovel
that I found at
the park. It's
a toy, but it has
nicked edges.
Lighting this up
might make things
brighter, but I'm
not supposed to
play with matches.
A voodoo doll
Hanako gave me.
If spirits see it,
they'll attack it.

A treat for pets
that looks like a
fish. If I give it
to animals, they
might like me.
A gold, clear,
candy that's as
pretty as a jewel.
It has a very,
very sweet smell.
It says the game
won't stop till I
give the Daruma
doll a right eye.

It's made of wood.
The white part of
the eye is dirty
and yellow and it
feels bumpy.
It's kind of
squishy, like
meat. Sometimes
it moves.

It's all torn up,
I can't read it!
It's all dirty,
too.

I have to copy the
letter and make
someone read it or
I'll be cursed!

A letter that got
sent to me. But
there's nothing
written inside.

A toy that the
Daruma from the
park gave me. I
put the eye in it.











Sis dropped this.
It fits right
in my palm.


It was left out in
the sun and dried
up. It hasn't
rained in a long
time.
A bone-shaped
dog treat.
Poro loves it. It
was hidden behind
the doghouse.
A blackboard
eraser from
school. How did it
get out here?

A tiny crane made
out of paper.
But it wasn't
folded quite right
so it looks funny.

























A note in sloppy
writing. It says
there's a path
by the Jizo Statue
near the school.





A key with a
chicken on it. Did
the person in
charge drop it?

There's a sticker
that says @pool@
on it. It's still
warm from the hen
sitting on it.










A small bone
that was stuck in
the drain.
Soft mold is
growing on it.
Sis's shoe that I
found at school.
It's got slobber
from the human-
faced dog on it.
A girl's swimsuit
that I found
in the pool.
It's torn up.

It's a bag with
straps. The
shoulder strap
is untied.

A robot made out
of snack boxes.
It's posed to look
like it's about
to fly into space.
@Stupid@...
@Annoying@...
@Disappear@...
Somebody wrote a
mean note on here.
An exam sheet with
a lot of mistakes.
It was balled up
and thrown out.

A brown recorder.
I can't play it
well, but Sis is
really good
at playing it.
Cloth shoes that
I wear in school.
It's slippery on
rainy days, so I
fall down a lot.
@Mom won't come
back home. Where
did she go at this
hour?@ That's what
the note says.





Smooth salt. The
centipede spirit
asked me to put it
in places around
town as a favor.

Smooth salt. The
centipede spirit
asked me to put it
in places around

Key to the North
fence downtown.
It's greasy and
very sticky.

Key to the South
fence downtown.
It's kinda bent. I
hope I can use it.

An old charm with
pretty colors.
It has an arch
and a centipede
mark on it.
A charm that
has a centipede
mark on it. The
bright red color
hasn't faded.
Made out of an ad
from a market.
I wonder where
it flew here from.

It's a simple,
throwaway camera.



A grown-up's shoes
placed neatly
together. I wonder
who put them here.

A great big fang
that's for sure
not from a human.
Did a spirit
lose its tooth?
An opened cup of
noodles that was
lying on the road.
It's steaming and
looks really warm.
A furball that
looks like a knot
of human hair.
It's as big as
my head!
@Mom was taken
by that spirit...
I have to save
her.@ That's what's
written on it.















Part of a wooden
board. It's soft
from being left
outside. It looks
dangerous...










A smudged note
that says, @give
it back, give it
back.@ I wonder
who it was for.
A key I found in
the field. I can't
get the smell of
dirt off of it.

A silver necklace
I found on a path.
It's rusty and
torn, but still
shining.
A long nail with
light red nail
polish on it.
It was buried
in the dirt.
An old shirt that
was balled up on
the street. It's
all sun faded and
beat up.
An hourglass with
pink sand in it.
It's wet, so the
sand doesn't move
if you flip it.
Rock hard, but it
has a soft mold
growing on it.
I don't feel like
eating it.
A very old and
beat-up rope.
It's torn, so
it's shorter.

In shaky letters
it says, @where is
it, give it back,
where is it,
give it back...@





A rusty key that
I got at the
factory. I can
barely tell that
it says @chimney.@










A key from deep
in the factory.
It has a strap
with the name of
the factory on it.
I found this, but
I don't know the
code to open it.
It's probably been
locked a long time.
A ring made out of
beads and string.
It fits perfectly
on my finger.

A piece of cloth
that had an anime
character on it.
It's been ripped
all over.
Maybe I could
use this on the
spirits. But I'm
not really that
strong...
It's an article
from when this
factory was still
open. There's a
picture of metal.





It's torn, but
this part says more
hand spirits show
up the deeper you
go in the tunnel...





A key I found by
the entrance to
the woods. For
some reason, it's
very cold.
Part of a collar.
It was freshly
washed, but it
still has Poro's
smell on it.
A little, dead bug.
It's cold and
hard. But, it's
still pretty and
shiny and green.
I need this to
use the pay phone,
but I've never
done that before.

It's a marble, but
the glass is
chipped and it
isn't round, so
it won't roll.
The middle part is
broken and the
lead is sticking
out. But I'll
still use it.
An old newspaper.
There's an article
about a festival
worshipping the
nearby mountain.










@I've been looking,
but I can't find
you. Are you gone
forever? Please...@
Is what it says.


















































A charm that Sis
always kept close
to her. When I
hold it, it feels
warm somehow.




















An old note. It
says the kidnapped
will be taken to
the other side of
the tunnel.
A used set of
crayons that got
really small.
Some are broken
and worn out.
A dog toy in the
shape of a bone.
Poro's favorite.


A round and shiny
candy ball. It's
dry, but it looks
like it's alive
and staring at me.
I use it to hide
the hole where my
eye was. I can't
see anymore, but
I saved Sis.















The doll's name
is Mary. She
gets lonely and
jealous easily.






A doll with pretty
black hair. 
Sometimes it looks
like it's staring
into me.
Someone that was
buried in the
ground. He looked
sad, so I snuck
him out.
I found this at
the vacant lot. It
makes a really
loud noise when I
kick it.
A small mummy.
It has a beak and
it also has fins.
I want to see the
original form.
A book about a
girl and a spirit
who lives under
her bed. They're
smiling together.
Sis fixed it with
the parts I
collected.
A machine that
plays music.
A kid's small,
pink sandal. It
makes a funny
noise when I step
on it.
You're allowed to
smoke when you're
a grown-up. But you
always have to throw
the butt away.
An egg that the
hen at school
laid. I hope a
chick hatches
soon!
A weird bottle.
The color, shape,
and the marble
inside makes me
feel nice, though.
If I keep on
hitting it, it
makes me kinda
happy.

The puzzle pieces
made a box. Seems
like something was
supposed to
happen.
A special coin
with ridged
edges. It's rare,
so I don't want
to use it.
A funny little
thing with a wide
body. It's cute,
so I think I'll
keep it as a pet.
A shiny reward
for me, who's
doing her best.
Congratulations.
Thank you.

There's a flashy poster.

It's a picture of
a blue penguin dancing.
I wonder what this is advertising...

it's wet from the rain.

A bright red postbox.
I never sent mail, so
I've never used it before.

Looks like I can't go past here...
Looks like I can't go past here...
Looks like I can't go past here...
I'm Miss Mary.
I'm right behind you.
Which side do I put the eye in?
Right
Left
Looks like you can dig here.
You need a shovel to dig...
Maybe there's one at the sandbox.
Looks like you can put something here.
A hole in the fence behind the tree!
I can go inside from here!
A door to the pool.
Do you want to use the key to the pool?
Door unlocked.
It's a drainpipe.
Could the pool be what the
table-turning was talking about?
Drain the pool and check the bottom?
It's a drain.
Ah! There's something stuck in there!
Grab it?
You picked up a shredded swimsuit.
Looks like it's locked.
The lock opened!
I can't go past this.
Let's keep playing.
Thanks.
Move to a different Jizo Statue?
It's an old, small shrine...
No one takes care of it and
it's run down.
was placed in the postbox.
Ah, looks like I dropped
the dull eyeball...
Yay!
Now I have all the puzzle pieces!
Listen to music on the radio?
I can't use this...
I've been walking around the town
looking for the puzzle pieces, so
I finally finished my map!
This thing won't work here...
Your left eye... Does it hurt?
I'm sorry, you did that for me...
...Thanks for helping me.
You pick up a lot of stuff...
Don't take anything that's not yours.
You're going out again?
Come home soon. I worry about you...
Should I buy some new shoes...?
I feel a presence when
I'm in this room.
I wonder who it is...
It doesn't seem evil...
I wonder what it's doing here...
Why does this town have so
many spirits...?
That lady who went missing in the
rice field turned up dead...
I heard her corpse was found and
sent back to her family.
They arrested the murderer, too.
It's kinda relieving...
The mountain spirit that took me
away was supposed to be a god once...
Everyone in the town praised it.
But, why did it kidnap me...?
I don't have to be scared
of that spirit anymore...?
Downtown is going to be totally
bulldozed before winter.
...Huh? Will the shrine downtown
be taken down too?
Yeah, looks like the shrine is
going to be taken down too...
It's sad without Poro...
Poro wasn't mad, right?
He's probably waiting for us in heaven,
so let's play with him when we get there.
Take care. Go...
You've got so many parts now.
If you get it repaired, it seems like
it could work... What do you wanna do?
Alright.
Okay, it'll be fixed by tomorrow.
It's been fixed!
Those were parts to the radio.
See, it's over there.
All the parts I had made a radio!
Night Town.
Sis went out to go look for Poro,
who ran away.
But, Sis didn't come back either...
I decided to go out there myself and
search for Poro and Sis.
They shouldn't be that far away.
Sis's shoe.
I remember her putting this on. She
wore this on the day she left.
Is she only wearing one shoe right now?
I have no clue where Sis went, but
I have to find her.
I should start at the rice fields...
Alone.
Why are all the spirits scaring me?
I just want to see my Sis.
I'm sad because I can't be with her.
...But, the spirits that have died
must be lonely, too...
I should be a little nicer to them.
I buried Poro.
Poro died because of me.
I couldn't tell Sis about him.
If I didn't throw the rock,
if I was able to tell my Sis...
What should I do? What should I do...?
Sis, will you be okay?
About the spirits.
I found so many scary things in town.
How many more times will I have
to be so afraid?
Will it be even scarier than ever?
But, I think Sis dying is more
scary than anything.
The Night Walker.
Sis told me she was kidnapped by the
spirit that walks around town at night.
Sis held her charm so tight that
it's all worn out.
But, if I hold it tight enough,
it makes my feelings warm.
Night Alone.
The night is coming to town.
It will come even if Sis isn't here,
or Poro, or even if
I'm not here.
The night will come, and the morning
will follow, then the night again.

Stay here.
I'll be right back.
Okay? It's a promise.
I'll be just fine,
I'll find him on my own.
Sis... It's getting late...
I'm gonna go look for her!
Welcome back... Huh?
!!!
You scared me! Did you come looking for me?
...
...Come here.
Hide in these bushes,
close your eyes, and
do *not* open them
no matter what happens.
Do *NOT* open them!
Do you understand?
...Sis?

Press $2.
...Sis?
Did you come looking for me?
Is this...Sis's...?
Let me turn the lights on...
Found a flashlight.
It's a Jizo Statue...
If you offer a coin to the Jizo Statue,
Is there anything I can offer...?
you can quicksave.
I'll give the Jizo Statue an offering.
Sis?
Sis...
Sis isn't here...
Pick up the pebble.
Did Sis go home already?
Let's go home.
Open the map with $7.
Ah!
...Poro!?
This doesn't open...
Can I get inside
somewhere else?
I should look around a bit.
It's Sis's shoe...
But why is it here?
...That wasn't Poro.
Ah!
I forgot about
Sis's shoe!
I have to go get it!


Maybe I can distract it with something.
It didn't like what I put there...
What should I put there?
It took the wet bone!
It's gone...
























Looks like it's locked...
The lock opened!
It won't open.
It's Sis's shoe...
To SAVE your progress,
you must save at the DESK.
I have to run...
Is that a phone ringing...?
D-Don't eat me!
A phone is ringing again...
...Th-That was scary...
...Huh? When did I get
salt in my hand?
Maybe it means I'm supposed to put it
back where it was in the first place.
I put all the salt in the right spots.
I should go tell that
to the centipede spirit.
The centipede spirit isn't here...
It wasn't such a bad spirit...
...Poro?
I hear a dog barking!
It might be Poro!
It's Poro's collar...
I'm sorry, Poro...
...It's Poro!
Poro, wake up!
Wake up, wake up!
...Wake up...
Poro, let's go home...
Poro, please wake up...
Poro...
...
...Where am I?
...I have to find the exit.
...It won't open.
It's a big container...
Maybe I can hide inside it.
There's a lock, I can't get it open.
Used the Rusty Small Key.
The spirit from the mountain...
This is...
Sis's charm...
...Sis...
There's something on the other side,
but the bridge is broken...
Can I get over there with something?
Picked up the Black Note.
Let's read the note.
It's gonna kill me, help me, help!!!
Help, help, help, help, help, help!!!
...Why do *I* have to die?
HELP ME HELP ME PLEASE
There's something wrong
with the flashlight...
The flashlight is
back to normal now.
...?
This is...
Put the Necklace down.
It's so foggy...
I shouldn't go in there right now...
A little shrine...
Huh?
Sis's charm is glowing!
Maybe I should lift it up...
It's so foggy...
I shouldn't go in there right now...
Sis is just past here...
Sis!
Sis?
...Sis...
Don't die,
Sis.
...
...Hm...?
Sis!!!
Are you okay!?
I came to look for you!
Let's go home...
...Sis...
I was so scared...
...I was so lonely, Sis...
...Let's go home together, please...
Huh...?
Uh...
What is this? It feels weird...
Uh...
...It's so dark.
...Like midnight.
Light... I have to turn the light on...
It's dark, I can't see anything...
...
